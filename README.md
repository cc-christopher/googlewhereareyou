It's an exploration!

# TensorFlow
Imagine a process to verify basic redundant figures. Maybe scales. Perhaps, some flows. These are laborous processes, yet so vital in large scale operations. With TensorFlow, we can train in certain expectations by Machine Learning, effectively reducing time for these tasks, freeing time for more open, challenging, and innovative wokrs.

Say in a chmeistry company we developed an in-silico laboratory, but in every process we rely human power to verify some basic chemical links from NMR spectroscopy. Apply learning, taking notes on repeated statistical hits. Done. We can focus on drug innovation end processes, rather than checking one process by another that their are indeed reacted properly.

# Google Cloud
Speak the same language. Speak at the same time.

Interconnected and advanced services build for large scale operations worldwide. Never worry about workload. Stay connected with different parts of the world with real live data. See in your own eyes how the data speaks. All in one Cloud. Google Cloud.

Remember that drug company? We can do much more, going to site to extract resources, bring the analysis to Cloud, get a resolution real time. Bring your innovation headquarters anywhere. Keep the progress anywhere.

Pick a desk, connect, and enjoy a warm sip of coffee for a while.
